# Global Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
This is my first Power BI project, focused on analyzing a global financial dataset. The goal of this project was to transform raw sales data into an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into product performance, regional sales, and profitability.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The analysis is based on a sales dataset encompassing:
* **Products:** Carretera, Paseo, Velo, VTT, Amarilla, and Montana.
* **Countries:** Germany, Canada, France, Mexico, and the USA.
* **Segments:** Government, Midmarket, Channel Partners, Small Business, and Enterprise.
* **Key Metrics:** Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Discounts, COGS, and Profit.

## 🚀 Key Features of the Dashboard
* **Executive Summary:** High-level cards showing Total Sales, Total Profit, and Total Units Sold.
* **Product Analysis:** A breakdown of which products drive the most revenue vs. which are most profitable.
* **Geographic Insights:** A map visualization showing sales distribution across North America and Europe.
* **Discount Impact:** Analysis of how "None" vs. "Low" discount bands affect the bottom line.
* **Temporal Trends:** A line chart showing sales fluctuations over the project's timeframe.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling and visualization.
* **Power Query:** For data cleaning and transformation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating calculated measures.

## 💡 Key Insights Found
1.  **Top Performer:** Identified which specific product (e.g., Paseo) dominates the sales volume.
2.  **Regional Leader:** Found that [Insert Country] leads in total profit despite [Insert Country] potentially having higher sales volume.
3.  **Profitability:** Observed how manufacturing costs vs. sale prices impact the net margin across different segments.

## 📈 Learning Journey & Growth
As this is my **first Power BI project**, I focused on the fundamentals of:
* Connecting to data sources.
* Basic data cleaning (removing nulls and formatting dates).
* Creating a cohesive color theme and user-friendly layout.

**Areas for Improvement:**
I am actively looking to improve my skills in:
* Writing complex DAX formulas (Time Intelligence).
* Advanced data modeling (Star Schema).
* Enhancing UI/UX design for better storytelling.
